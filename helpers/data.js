    content: `A prenuptial agreement (also known as a pre-nup)  is a formal, written agreement between two partners prior to their marriage. It sets out ownership of all their belongings (including money, assets and property) and explains how it will be divided in the event of the breakdown of their marriage. Prenuptial agreements are perceived by some to be pessimistic and unromantic. Others argue that a prenup can circumvent time, expense and acrimony.`,
